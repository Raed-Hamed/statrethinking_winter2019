The layout for the following notebooks will first go through the book chapter's practice section and then tackle the homeworks provided online. In between, I might copy code sections from the book to facilitate the practical aspects associated to the learning and application of the methods of interest.

*Disclaimer: The answers provided here are not only mine and are not necessarily correct*

### Practice 2.6.

##### **Easy:**

* **2E1.** The expressions that correspond to the "The probability of rain on Monday" are: Pr(rain|Monday) and Pr(rain,Monday) / Pr(Monday) --

* **2E2.** The probability that it is Monday given that it is raining corresponds to the expression Pr(Monday|Rain)

* **2E3.** Pr(Monday|Rain) and Pr(rain|Monday) * Pr(Monday) / Pr(rain) [according to Bayes rule] corresponds to the statement: "The probability that it is Monday given that it is raining"

* **2E4.** With regards to the global tossing example from the chapter, saying that "the probability of water is 0.7 " implies that given our limited knowledge and based on the outcomes of the experiment, our best guess of the true proportion of water in the globe is 0.7. --

                      )
# compute product of likelihood and prior

# standardize the posterior, so it sums to 1

* **2M4** 
Card1: B/B Card2: B/W Card3: W/W

If we observed one black side up, there are 2 ways of producing the black side up if we pick the B/B card and one way if we pick the B/W card, so in total, 2 of 3 ways are consistent with the other side of the card being black. The answer is 2/3.

* **2M5** 
With an extra B/B card:

If we observe one black side up, there are 4 ways of producing the black side up (2 for each B/B card) and 1 for picking the B/W card. The total probability that the other side is black is thus: 4/5

* **2M6** 
Card1: B/B Card2: B/W Card3: W/W

Black sides are heavier than cards with white sides so it is less likely that a card with black sides is pulled from the bag.

There are still 2 ways for B/B to produce a black side up, 1 way for B/W and zero ways for W/W. But according to the prior information, there is 1 way to get the B/B card, 2 ways to get the B/W card and 3 ways to get the W/W card so:

The total ways for the B/B card to produce a black side up are 2 * 1 and the total ways for the B/W card to produce a black side up are 1 * 2.

So, there are 4 ways total to see a black side up and 2 of these come from the B/B card hence the probability that the other side is black is now at 0.5 

* **2M7**  --
Card1: B/B Card2: B/W Card3: W/W

The B/B card has 2 ways to produce an observation with the black side up. This leaves the B/W and the W/W card with the job of producing the next observation. The B/W has only 1 way to produce a white side up while the W/W has 2 ways. So there are 3 ways to get the second card to show the white side up. Assuming the first card is B/B, there are 6 ways to see the BW sequence.

If however the B/W card is drawn first, there is 1 way for it to show the black side up. This leaves the other two cards to show the white side up. The B/B canâ€™t show white while W/W has 2 ways to show white up so that is 2 ways to see the sequence Black and White when the first card drawn is B/W.

The probability is thus: 8 total ways of producing the sequence BW with 6 ways with B/B being drawn first.
